# Casey-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

* My motivation for this project was to create a user friendly weather board where the user can search the temperature of any city around the world and they will be given that given locations conditions for the next 5 days.

* The construction of this project was to create a functional HTML code base with the introduciton of server side WEB API's to construct a fucntional weather dashboard.

* Creating a user friendly code base along with semantcic structuring of code allows users to deep dive the functionality of the code itself, doing so creates a more coherent experience for the user aswell as any curious developers.

* The taking on of this challenge was rather difficult in certain aspects especially the javascript API coding but it has allowed for a deeper understanding of how these two things interact with one another.

## Usage

Using this website is very easy to use simply enter a desired city location and the WEB API will fetch the coordinates of said location and relay the weather conditions for the following 5 day period. Viewing the console commands will reveal how each process is done.

## Future Updates

* I will add a search history html element and javascript local storage function to save users previous city searches for future reference upon returning to the site.
